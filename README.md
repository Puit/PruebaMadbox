# PruebaMadbox
Juego de prueba para Madbox
The time it took you to perform the exercise:
 5h
- The parts that were difficult for you and why
I couldn't fix the rotation of the player, it follows the path but it doesn't rotate propertly, I thing that I can fix it if I use other sistem like creating the targets by myself, but I didn't had time.
- The parts you think you could do better and how
I can create more, damaging objects, also a more detailed end, and connectivity to play with other players with Photon.
- What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
I would fix the problem that I had, I would make a menu, add music and sound...
- What did you think
I've been working mostly in 2d and I had some troubles with 3d physics but I'm happy with the result in just 5h.
- Any comment you may have
It would have been helpful to have had the tilesets and some objects to work, cause I had to use some time creating them or looking for them online.
